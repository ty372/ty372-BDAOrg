My name is Tian Yu, and now I'm a master student in applied statistics. I studied mathematics in University of Toronto before I came to Cornell. I've been always passionate to learn new statistical theories and the technique for solving problems that involves data. I'm interested in taking this course because I mostly study frequentist statistics, and not too much bayesian. I am hoping by taking this course, I can have a basic idea of how bayesian statistics works, and try to solve some data analysis problem in both frequentist perspective and bayesian perspective. I am also hoping that this course can help me to prepare me for the work in industry or academia in the future.  I'm currently doing my master's project  in studying data which involves the relationship between functional connections and the structual connections in human's brain. And we are doing the project with data that contains two groups of people. One group is the health control group, and the other group is the group with multiple sclerosis. We have the data of the Pearson Correlation coefficient and other relevant data and are trying to understand the the relationship in both groups.
